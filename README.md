### Faceboot lets me click stuff with code.
### It's nearly completely useless on it's own.
# But it lets you pipe things to Facebook!

    faceboot -e "email@place.com" -p "thisismyrealpassword" post "I sure do like pie."

All that email/password typing got you down?
## Save it!

    faceboot -e "email@place.com" -p "imtiredoftypingthisout" --save
 
Now you can post with a simple

    faceboot post "Look ma, no password!"

Really want to show everyone on facebook that output your terminal is
feeding to let them know you're cooler than them? 
##PIPE IT!

    echo "How did this get here oh god." | faceboot
